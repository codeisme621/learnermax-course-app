# Authentication Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. NextAuth v4 Setup
- **File**: `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`
- Configured Cognito provider with OAuth
- Implemented JWT session strategy with automatic token refresh
- Custom callbacks for session and JWT management

### 2. TypeScript Types
- **File**: `types/next-auth.d.ts`
- Extended NextAuth Session interface with `accessToken`, `idToken`, `error`, and user `id`
- Extended JWT interface with token fields and expiration

### 3. Session Provider
- **File**: `components/providers/session-provider.tsx`
- Client-side wrapper for NextAuth SessionProvider
- Integrated into root layout at `app/layout.tsx`

### 4. Cognito Service Utility
- **File**: `lib/cognito.ts`
- Direct Cognito SDK integration for sign-up and verification
- Functions:
  - `signUp()` - Register new users with email/password
  - `confirmSignUp()` - Verify email with confirmation code
  - `resendConfirmationCode()` - Resend verification code

### 5. Enrollment Form Updates
- **File**: `components/enrollment/EnrollmentForm.tsx`
- Integrated with Cognito sign-up API
- Added loading states and error handling
- Redirects to email verification page after successful sign-up

### 6. Email Verification Flow
- **File**: `app/verify-email/page.tsx`
- **File**: `components/enrollment/VerifyEmailForm.tsx`
- Complete verification flow with code input
- Resend code functionality
- Success state with auto-redirect to sign-in

### 7. Google OAuth Integration
- **File**: `components/enrollment/GoogleSignInButton.tsx`
- Updated to use NextAuth's `signIn()` function
- Configured to redirect to dashboard after successful OAuth

### 8. Environment Configuration
- **File**: `.env.local` (created with actual values)
- **File**: `.env.local.example` (template for other developers)
- Configured both server-side (NextAuth) and client-side (Cognito SDK) variables

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generated-secret>

# Cognito (server-side for NextAuth)
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_wpkRucihx
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=42k0e65ov865nr1l7d6l3cujqh
COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=
COGNITO_ISSUER_URL=https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_wpkRucihx
COGNITO_REGION=us-east-1

# Cognito (client-side for direct SDK calls)
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_wpkRucihx
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=42k0e65ov865nr1l7d6l3cujqh
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REGION=us-east-1

# Backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://ey5hap2qbc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod
```

## User Flows

### Email/Password Sign-Up Flow
1. User fills form at `/enroll`
2. Form calls `signUp()` from `lib/cognito.ts`
3. Cognito creates user and sends verification email
4. User redirected to `/verify-email?email=<email>`
5. User enters 6-digit code
6. Form calls `confirmSignUp()` to verify
7. On success, redirects to NextAuth sign-in page
8. After sign-in, PostConfirmation Lambda triggers
9. SNS message sent to Student Onboarding Lambda
10. Student record created in DynamoDB

### Google OAuth Flow
1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. NextAuth initiates OAuth flow with Cognito
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Cognito creates/links account
5. NextAuth creates session with JWT tokens
6. User redirected to dashboard
7. PostConfirmation Lambda triggers (if new user)
8. Student record created in DynamoDB

## Testing Instructions

### Local Development
1. Start the frontend dev server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000/enroll

### Test Email Sign-Up
1. Fill in name, email, password
2. Submit form
3. Check email for verification code
4. Enter code on verification page
5. Should redirect to sign-in page

### Test Google OAuth
1. Click "Continue with Google"
2. Authenticate with Google account
3. Should redirect to dashboard (or configured callback URL)

### Verify Backend Integration
1. After sign-up and verification, check CloudWatch logs for:
   - PostConfirmation Lambda execution
   - SNS message publishing
   - Student Onboarding Lambda execution
   - Student API POST request

2. Query DynamoDB Students table to verify record creation

## Known Issues / Notes

- Google OAuth requires Cognito hosted UI to be fully configured with Google OAuth credentials
- Client secret is optional for public clients (current setup)
- Token refresh happens automatically in NextAuth callbacks
- PostConfirmation trigger only fires after email verification is complete

## Next Steps for Manual Testing

1. Test email sign-up flow end-to-end
2. Test email verification with valid/invalid codes
3. Test resend verification code
4. Test Google OAuth (requires Google OAuth setup in Cognito)
5. Verify PostConfirmation Lambda triggers correctly
6. Verify Student record created in DynamoDB
7. Test token refresh functionality
8. Test sign-out flow
