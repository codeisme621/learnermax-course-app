# Spec to Implementation Plan

You are given a specification file that defines the intent of the feature. Your job is to turn that intent into a temporal, phased implementation plan that the user can review and approve before actual implementation begins.

## Core Guidelines

1. **Ask questions and be interactive** - Look for scenarios missed in the specification or confusing requirements. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify intent and validate assumptions.
2. **Research the codebase first** - Use Task tool with Explore/Plan agents to understand existing patterns, architectures, and dependencies before planning.
3. **Do not jump to code** - Create a detailed implementation plan broken down into temporal phases. Show what depends on what.
4. **Present plan for approval** - Always get user approval on the full phased implementation plan before implementing.
5. **Track progress during implementation** - Use TodoWrite to track phases. Write progress updates, decisions, and deviations back to the specification file during implementation.

## Implementation Planning Best Practices

These patterns help create clear, temporal implementation plans that ensure all critical concerns are addressed.

### 1. Temporal Phase Ordering

Think through implementation in logical layers. While you can adapt the order based on feature needs, ensure all relevant phases are considered:

**Common phase ordering:**
1. **Types/Contracts** - Define interfaces, schemas, data structures first
2. **Domain Logic** - Core business logic and validation
3. **Persistence** - Database operations, queries, data access
4. **API Layer** - HTTP handlers, endpoints, request/response mapping
5. **UI Components** - Frontend components that consume the API

**Example - Feature: Course Enrollment**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Types & Contracts
- Define `EnrollmentEntity` for DynamoDB
- Define `EnrollmentRequest` and `EnrollmentResponse` types
- Update Student type to include `enrolledCourses: string[]`

↓ (Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 types)

## Phase 2: Domain Logic
- Create `enrollStudent()` function with validation:
  - Check if student already enrolled
  - Verify course exists
  - Check enrollment capacity
- Return typed result

↓ (Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 logic)

## Phase 3: Persistence
- Create `saveEnrollment()` DynamoDB operation
- Add GSI query for "get enrollments by student"
- Transaction: Update Student.enrolledCourses + Create EnrollmentEntity

↓ (Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 persistence)

## Phase 4: API Endpoints
- POST /api/enroll endpoint
- GET /api/students/:id/enrollments endpoint
- Error handling: 400 (already enrolled), 404 (course not found)
```

**When to reorder:** If adding a feature to existing domain logic, you might start with persistence changes, then update domain, then types. Always justify the ordering.

### 2. Observability - Logs That Prove Behavior

Define what to log, when, and why. Logs should prove your system is behaving correctly and help debug when it's not.

**DO ✅ - Structured logs with context**
```typescript
// Log business events with context
logger.info('Student enrolled in course', {
  studentId,
  courseId,
  enrollmentId,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});

// Log validation failures for debugging
logger.warn('Enrollment rejected - already enrolled', {
  studentId,
  courseId,
  attemptedAt: new Date().toISOString()
});

// Log errors with full context
logger.error('Failed to save enrollment', {
  error: err.message,
  stack: err.stack,
  studentId,
  courseId
});
```

**DON'T ❌ - Logs without context**
```typescript
logger.info('Enrollment successful');  // Which student? Which course?
logger.error('Database error');         // What operation failed?
```

**Observability proves system behavior:**
- Success logs prove happy path works
- Warning logs prove validation is enforcing rules
- Error logs prove failures are caught and handled
- Include correlation IDs to trace requests across services

### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

Address these architectural concerns in your plan when relevant:

**Idempotency & Retry-Safety**
```markdown
## Idempotency Strategy
- POST /api/enroll: Use idempotency key (studentId + courseId)
- Check if enrollment exists before creating → Return 200 if already enrolled
- DynamoDB conditional writes: "only create if not exists"
```

**Rate Limiting (when needed)**
```markdown
## Rate Limiting
- Limit enrollment API to 10 requests/minute per student
- Use API Gateway throttling or in-memory rate limiter
```

**Error Handling Patterns**
```markdown
## Error Handling
- 400: Invalid request (missing fields, invalid format)
- 404: Resource not found (student or course doesn't exist)
- 409: Conflict (already enrolled, course full)
- 500: Server errors (database unavailable, unexpected errors)
```

**Security Considerations**
```markdown
## Security
- Verify authenticated user can only enroll themselves (studentId === session.userId)
- Don't expose enrollment IDs in URLs (use studentId + courseId instead)
- Sanitize course data before returning to client
```

### 4. Testing Strategy - Categories & Test Names

Define test categories and list specific test names. This proves comprehensive coverage without writing actual test code.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (5 tests)
**File:** `backend/src/features/enrollment/enrollment.service.test.ts`
1. `enrollStudent_success_createsEnrollment`
2. `enrollStudent_alreadyEnrolled_returnsConflict`
3. `enrollStudent_courseNotFound_throwsError`
4. `enrollStudent_courseFull_throwsError`
5. `calculateEnrollmentCount_returnsCorrectCount`

### Integration Tests (3 tests)
**File:** `backend/src/features/enrollment/enrollment.api.test.ts`
1. `POST_/api/enroll_validRequest_returns201`
2. `POST_/api/enroll_duplicateEnrollment_returns200Idempotent`
3. `GET_/api/students/:id/enrollments_returnsEnrollmentsList`

### E2E Tests (2 tests)
**File:** `e2e/tests/enrollment.spec.ts`
1. `Student can enroll in available course and see it in dashboard`
2. `Student cannot enroll in course twice`
```

**Why categorize:** Unit tests validate business logic in isolation. Integration tests validate API contracts and database operations. E2E tests validate complete user workflows.

### 5. New Libraries (Only When Needed)

Only include this section if new dependencies are required. If using existing libraries, skip this section.

**Example when needed:**
```markdown
## New Libraries Required

### `zod` (v3.22.0)
**Why:** Runtime request validation for enrollment API
**Usage:** Define EnrollmentRequestSchema, validate req.body before processing
**Alternative considered:** Manual validation (rejected - error-prone)

### `uuid` (v9.0.0)
**Why:** Generate unique enrollment IDs
**Usage:** `enrollmentId = uuidv4()`
```
