# Spec to implementation plan
You are given a specification file that defines the intent of the feature.  Your job is to turn that intent into a phased implementation plan.

## Guidelines
1) Ask questions and be interactive. Look for scenarios missed in the specificaiton file or any confusing requirements that you need clarification. You should use tools such as AskUserQuestion
2) Do not jump to code, come up with a detailed implementation plan broken down into phases
3) Do Research on the codebase when designing phased implementation plan.  You can use tools such as Task to launch agents such as Explore, Plan
4) Always ask user to approve the phased implementation plan before actually implementing
5) During the actual implementation, use the specification file to write back progress updates,
  decisions, and deviations.  Use the TodoWrite tool to remind yourself you can and should use the specification file during implementation
