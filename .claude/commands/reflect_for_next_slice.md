# Reflect for next slice.
You want to identify Forward-Looking Requirements.  So, reflect on the changes just made, the current slice, and the future slices to come. If there are any important specification details that would help the next slice that currently isnt captured as intent in the future slices, then we should detail this out.

## Guidelines
1) Only look for intent requirements focusing on WHAT not HOW.  
2) Only new uncaptured intent should be detailed out.  If the intent is already captured in the future spec/slice, then no need to detail this out.
3) The new intent insights should be based on the recent changes made. For example, if we devated from this current slice's plan/intent as we found something that caused us to change during implementation phase, then this insight would not be captured in the future slices as they were produced during the planning phase.
4) Review the intent insights with user before actually making any changes to future specs/slices.  Only when the user gives explict approval to change the spec/slice should you make a change.
5) If true new insight of intent requirements found and user approves, then we should modify all the effected future specs/slices.
