# Create Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if parameters were provided**:
   - If a file path or task reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message
   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY
   - Begin the research process

2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:
```
I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.

Please provide:
1. The task description or requirements
2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements
3. Links to related research or previous implementations

I'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.

Tip: You can also invoke this command with a task description directly: `/create_plan "Add user authentication to the API"`
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis

1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:
   - Research documents (e.g., `specs/user_auth/research.md` or `specs/user_auth/slices/login_flow/research.md`)
   - Related implementation plans
   - Any JSON/data files mentioned
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context
   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely

2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:
   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:

   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the task
   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works
   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find similar existing implementations

   These agents will:
   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests
   - Identify the specific directories to focus on
   - Trace data flow and key functions
   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references

3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:
   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant
   - Read them FULLY into the main context
   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding

4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:
   - Cross-reference the task requirements with actual code
   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings
   - Note assumptions that need verification
   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality

5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:
   ```
   Based on my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

   I've found that:
   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]
   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]
   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]

   Questions that my research couldn't answer:
   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]
   - [Business logic clarification]
   - [Design preference that affects implementation]
   ```

   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

After getting initial clarifications:

1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:
   - DO NOT just accept the correction
   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information
   - Read the specific files/directories they mention
   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself

2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks

3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - Use the right agent for each type of research:

   **For deeper investigation:**
   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., "find all files that handle [specific component]")
   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., "analyze how [system] works")
   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after

   Each agent knows how to:
   - Find the right files and code patterns
   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow
   - Look for integration points and dependencies
   - Return specific file:line references
   - Find tests and examples

4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding

5. **Present findings and design options**:
   ```
   Based on my research, here's what I found:

   **Current State:**
   - [Key discovery about existing code]
   - [Pattern or convention to follow]

   **Design Options:**
   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]
   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]

   **Open Questions:**
   - [Technical uncertainty]
   - [Design decision needed]

   Which approach aligns best with your vision?
   ```

### Step 3: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline**:
   ```
   Here's my proposed plan structure:

   ## Overview
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Implementation Phases:
   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]

   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?
   ```

2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details

### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

1. **Write the plan** where:
   - **Feature-level**: `specs/<feature-name>/plan.md` (e.g., `specs/user_authentication/plan.md`)
   - **Slice-level**: `specs/<feature-name>/slices/<slice-name>/plan.md` (e.g., `specs/user_authentication/slices/login_flow/plan.md`)
   - Use slice-level path when planning a specific slice from `specs/<feature-name>/slices/<slice-name>.md`
   - Use feature-level path when planning the entire feature

2. **Use this template structure**:

````markdown
# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State

[A specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:
- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## What We're NOT Doing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1. [Component/File Group]
**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary of changes]

```[language]
// Specific code to add/modify
```

### Success Criteria:

#### Continuous Validation (During Implementation):
- [ ] Run `pnpm test [file]` after each significant change - all pass
- [ ] Monitor dev server logs via `pnpm run dev:logs` - no errors
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl - correct responses
- [ ] Check TypeScript compilation - no type errors

#### Phase Completion Validation:
- [ ] All unit tests pass: `cd backend && pnpm test`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `pnpm run typecheck`
- [ ] Linting passes: `pnpm run lint`
- [ ] Test coverage meets 90% threshold: `pnpm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm run build`
- [ ] Local dev server runs without errors
- [ ] API endpoints tested with curl and respond correctly

#### Preview Deployment Validation:
- [ ] Backend deployed successfully: `./scripts/deploy-preview-backend.sh`
- [ ] Frontend deployed successfully: `./scripts/deploy-preview-frontend.sh`
- [ ] E2E tests created in `e2e/tests/[feature-name].spec.ts`
- [ ] E2E tests pass: `cd e2e && pnpm test`
- [ ] No errors in backend logs: `scripts/.sam-logs.log`
- [ ] No errors in frontend logs: `scripts/.vercel-logs.log`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- [What to test]
- [Key edge cases]

### Integration Tests:
- [End-to-end scenarios]

### E2E Tests (Created During Preview Validation):
- [User flow to test in preview environment]
- [Integration between frontend and backend]
- [Critical path testing]

**Note**: E2E tests are written and run against the preview environment after local implementation is complete. This validates the feature in a production-like setting with full stack integration.

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. [Specific step to verify feature]
2. [Another verification step]
3. [Edge case to test manually]

## Performance Considerations

[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]

## Migration Notes

[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]

## References

- Related research: `specs/<feature-name>/research.md` (or `specs/<feature-name>/slices/<slice-name>/research.md`)
- Main spec (if this is a slice): `specs/<feature-name>/mainspec.md`
- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`
````

### Step 5: Review

1. **Present the draft plan location**:
   ```
   I've created the initial implementation plan at:
   `specs/<feature-name>/plan.md` (or `specs/<feature-name>/slices/<slice-name>/plan.md`)

   Please review it and let me know:
   - Are the phases properly scoped?
   - Are the success criteria specific enough?
   - Any technical details that need adjustment?
   - Missing edge cases or considerations?
   ```

2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:
   - Add missing phases
   - Adjust technical approach
   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)
   - Add/remove scope items

3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**:
   - Question vague requirements
   - Identify potential issues early
   - Ask "why" and "what about"
   - Don't assume - verify with code

2. **Be Interactive**:
   - Don't write the full plan in one shot
   - Get buy-in at each major step
   - Allow course corrections
   - Work collaboratively

3. **Be Thorough**:
   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers
   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction

4. **Be Practical**:
   - Focus on incremental, testable changes
   - Consider migration and rollback
   - Think about edge cases
   - Include "what we're NOT doing"

5. **Track Progress**:
   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks
   - Update todos as you complete research
   - Mark planning tasks complete when done

6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:
   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP
   - Research or ask for clarification immediately
   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions
   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable
   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan

## Success Criteria Guidelines

**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**

1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):
   - Commands that can be run: `pnpm run test`, etc.
   - Specific files that should exist
   - Code compilation/type checking
   - Automated test suites

2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):
   - UI/UX functionality
   - Performance under real conditions
   - Edge cases that are hard to automate
   - User acceptance criteria

## Common Patterns

### For Database Changes:
- Start with schema/migration
- Add database access methods
- Update business logic
- Expose via API
- Update clients

### For New Features:
- Research existing patterns first
- Start with data model
- Build backend logic
- Add API endpoints
- Implement UI last

### For Refactoring:
- Document current behavior
- Plan incremental changes
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Include migration strategy

## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices

When spawning research sub-tasks:

1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency
2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area
3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:
   - Exactly what to search for
   - Which directories to focus on
   - What information to extract
   - Expected output format
4. **Be specific about directories and components**
5. **Specify read-only tools** to use
6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses
7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing
8. **Verify sub-task results**:
   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks
   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase
   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect
